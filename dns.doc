use struct.pack/unpack to convert byte <-> value


** DNS Header
ID: 2 byte
 :[
QR: 1 bit 0: query, 1: response
Opcode: 4 bit, 0=standard query
AA: 1 bit 0 in query, 1 in response
TC: 1 bit 0 not truncated
RD: 1 bit 0 in all
RA: 1 bit 0 in all
Z: 3 bit 0 in all
RCODE: 4 bit
 0 = no error
 1 = format error
]
below 2 byte each:
QDCOUNT = # question  
ANCOUNT = # answer
NSCOUNT = 0
ARCOUNT = 0

** DNS Question
QNAME:sequence of 1byte(indicating length n) + n byte name + ... + 1
